TODO:

1) make a real readme
2) document how to add boards
3) some boards need different bootscripts and config files.  How to support that? (MACNICA needs jic and no HPS fpga config)
4) add 1.3 Macnica board
5) add DE0 nano
6) add support for compiling sw source (including kernel modules)
7) validate images on all boards


questions

1) how does a user get their app to the board
	a) ssh?
	b) ftp?
2) should i spew out a default sdcard.img so that users could program on winblows and update the preloader using chris's utility?
