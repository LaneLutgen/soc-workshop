This directory contains a number of target test 'expect' scripts.  These are run
on the host machine that is connected to the target with the USB serial cable,
USB OTG cable and USB Blaster II JTAG cable.

reboot_target.exp
	This script will connect to the target over the USB serial interface and
	issue the 'reboot' command, and then wait for the target to reach the
	linux login prompt.

general_target_test.exp
	This script will connect to the target over the USB serial interface and
	the USB OTG interface an test various aspect of the target and host
	environment.

fft_target_test.exp
	This script will connect to the target over the USB Blaster II interface
	and the USB serial interface to test the FFT peripherals in the FPGA
	which are used by the WS1 lab material.  This test uses the fft.tcl and
	fft.sh scripts during it's execution.

drivers_target_test.exp
	This script will connect to the target over the USB OTG interface using
	the emulated network interface with an SSH connection.  It then tests
	the functionality required by the WS3 demonstration script.
